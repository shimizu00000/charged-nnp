<step1>
char: charge state
dir: directory name in ./data_vasp
input_tag.dat: data name

For example, the files {OSZICAR, OUTCAR, XDATCAR}_nvac3_111_1 (data id = 1 of V_N^3+) are stored in ./data_vasp/nvac3_111.
By setting char: 3, dir: nvac3_111, input_tag.dat: nvac3_111_1, and then running ./extract_from_vasp.sh, the required information will be extracted from the VASP output files and compiled into ./data_nnp.

<step2>
The files in data_nnp are converted to binary format.

<step3>
The symmetry functions (SFs) are calculated.

<training>
1. The maximum and minimum SF values in the training data are checked using maxmin_sf.
2. After copying the data_maxmin file generated by maxmin_sf into the training directory, you can proceed with the training.
   input_nnp.dat is the configuration file, and input_tag_training.dat is the list of training data.
3. The lammps directory is used for generating a pair potential file for lammps.
